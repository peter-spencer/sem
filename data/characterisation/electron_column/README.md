# Frequency response of the SEM coils

## Setup

Signal generator with 50 Ohm output impedance was then connected to the coil under test in series with a 10 kilohm resistor. The terminal of the coil under test that was connected to the signal generator was the 0 Volt earth.

For the shielding test, the shield wire was connected to the same earth as the coil under test.
