# Frequency response of the spare SEM coil assembly

There was a spare coil assembly included in the accessories that came with the SEM, this is the results of measuring the coils.

## Setup

Signal generator with 50 Ohm output impedance was then connected to the coil under test in series with a 10 kilohm resistor. The terminal of the coil under test that was connected to the signal generator was the 0 Volt earth.
