This is a project to restore this old electron microscope and put it back to use again.

So far, the vacuum system, electron column, and specimen chamber has been stripped-down, cleaned and re-assembled. The electronics have been tested and an image was achieved but the old components have suffered several failures.

Currently the focus is to understand and repair the electronics, as well as documenting the whole system for anyone else restorting a similar ISI microscope.

Hardware will be documented as needed during the refurb, currently there is:
- Scanned user manual and troubleshooting
- Scanned original circuit schematics
- A few digitised circuit schematics
