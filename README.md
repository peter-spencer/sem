This is a project to restore this old electron microscope and put it back to use again.

So far, the vacuum system, electron column, and specimen chamber has been stripped-down, cleaned and re-assembled. The electronics have been tested and an image was achieved but the old components have suffered several failures.

Currently the focus is to understand and repair the electronics, as well as documenting the whole system for anyone else restorting a similar ISI microscope. There is documentation in the [Wiki](../../wiki).

Hardware will be documented as needed during the refurb, currently there is:
- Scanned user manual and troubleshooting
- [Wiki](../../wiki) with [digitised user manual](../../wiki/Original-Instruction-Manual)
- Scanned original circuit schematics
- A few digitised circuit schematics

## List of related ISI microscopes

There's a comprehensive archive of manuals and schematics for similar ISI microscopes [here in microwiki.org](https://microwiki.org/wiki/index.php/SEM_I-O).

The data in this repository is relevant to the following models of ISI microscopes:

- MSM-4
- SMS-2 Models: Super-I, Super-II, Super-III
- Super Mini SEM

Other ISI microscopes seem to share features with these models and so this list is probably not complete.
